 id="Tmp"><h2>What is Temperature?</h2>
In a qualitative manner, we can describe the temperature of an object as
that which determines the sensation of warmth or coldness felt from
contact with it.<P>
It is easy to demonstrate that when two objectsof the same material are
placed together
(physicists say when they are put in thermal contact), the object with
the higher temperature
cools while the cooler object becomes warmer until a point is reached
after which no more change occurs, and to our senses, they feel the same. When the thermal changes have stopped, we
say that the two objects (physicists define them more rigorously as systems)
are in <i> thermal equilibrium </i>. We can then define the temperature
of the system by saying that the temperature is that quantity which is the
same for both systems when they are in thermal equilibrium.<P>
If we experiment further with more than two systems, we find that many
systems can be brought into thermal equilibrium with each other; thermal
equilibrium does not depend on the kind of object used. Put more precisely,
<P><i> if two systems are separately in thermal equilibrium with a third,
then they must also be in thermal equilibrium with each other</i>, <P> and
they all have the same temperature regardless of the kind of systems they
are.<P>
The statement in italics, called the <i> zeroth law of thermodynamics</i>
may be restated as follows: <blockquote>If three or more systems are in
thermal contact with each other and all in equilibrium together, then
any two taken separately are in equilibrium with one another. (quote from
T. J. Quinn's monograph <i>Temperature</i>) </blockquote>
Now one of the three systems could be an instrument calibrated to measure
the temperature - i.e. a thermometer. When a calibrated thermometer is put
in thermal contact with a system and reaches thermal equilibrium, we then
have a quantitative measure of the temperature of the system. For example,
a mercury-in-glass clinical thermometer is put under the tongue of a patient
and allowed to reach thermal equilibrium in the patient's mouth - we then
see by how much the silvery mercury has expanded in the stem and read
the scale of the thermometer to find the patient's temperature.
<h2>What is a Thermometer? </h2>
A thermometer is an instrument that measures the temperature of a system
in a quantitative way. The easiest way to do this is to find a substance
having a property that changes in a regular way with its temperature.
The most direct 'regular' way is a linear one: <P>
t(x) = ax + b,<P>
where t is the temperature of the substance and changes as the property x
of the substance changes. The constants a and b depend on the substance
used and may be evaluated by specifying two temperature points on the
scale, such as 32&#176; for the freezing point of water and 212&#176; for
its boiling point. <P>
For example, the element mercury is liquid in the temperature range of
-38.9&#176; C to 356.7&#176; C (we'll discuss the Celsius &#176; C scale
later). As a liquid, mercury expands as it gets warmer, its expansion
rate is linear and can be accurately calibrated.</p>

 The mercury-in-glass thermometer illustrated in the above figure contains a
bulb filled with mercury that is allowed to expand into a capillary. Its
rate of expansion is calibrated on the glass scale.

<H2> The Development of Thermometers and Temperature Scales</h2>
<i>The historical highlights in the development of thermometers and their scales
given here are based on "Temperature" by T. J. Quinn and "Heat" by James M. Cork.</i>
<P> One of the first attempts to make a standard temperature scale occurred about
 AD 170, when <a href="galen.html">Galen</a>, in his medical writings, proposed
 a standard "neutral" temperature made up of equal quantities of boiling water
 and ice; on either side of this temperature were four degrees of heat and four
 degrees of cold, respectively.
<P> The earliest devices used to measure the temperature were called thermoscopes.
<img src="thrmscp.gif" alt="Temperature"> They consisted of a glass bulb having
 a long tube extending downward into a container of colored water, although <a href="Galileo.jpg">Galileo</a>
 in 1610 is supposed to have used wine. Some of the air in the bulb was expelled
 before placing it in the liquid, causing the liquid to rise into the tube. As
 the remaining air in the bulb was heated or cooled, the level of the liquid
 in the tube would vary reflecting the change in the air temperature. An engraved
 scale on the tube allowed for a quantitative measure of the fluctuations.
The air in the bulb is referred to as the <i> thermometric medium</i>, i.e.
 the medium whose property changes with temperature.
In 1641, the first sealed thermometer that used liquid rather than air as
 the thermometric medium was developed for Ferdinand I
